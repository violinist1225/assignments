1. forEach method:

loops through entire array (unlike a for loop which can be customized).
And variable is NOT assigned to it as it's purpose is to loop, NOT build anything.

Example: array.forEach() => {}

Returns: Undefined 
    Purpose: Used in place of a for-loop
        Caveat: For-loops allow you to customize where the loop starts, stops, and increments by.
                forEach will always loop the entire length of the array.


# .find()
    Returns: The first item it finds in the array that matches your criteria
    Purpose: Finding an item in an array


    
# .findIndex()
    Returns: The index number of the first item it finds in the array that matches your criteria
    Purpose: Finding the index number of an item in an array

# .some()
    Returns: Returns true if at least one item in the array matches your criteria, false otherwise
    Purpose: To see if something exists in an array
    

# .every()
    Returns: Returns true if EVERY item in the array matches your criteria, false otherwise.
    Purpose: TO see if Everything in an array matches your criteria

    # .sort()
    Returns: The array sorted but sort also mutates the original array, so capturing the returned value
     is not necessary.
    Purpose: To sort an unsorted array of items.
