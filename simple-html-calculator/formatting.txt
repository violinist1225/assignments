Formatting Notes:

IN JAVASCRIPT:

if a line has an opening curly, find that blocks closing curly and make sure both lines have the 
same level of indentation.
A lines that are nested one layer in that block will get just one more indentation.


*********************

IN HTML:

 In HTML every elements closing and opening tag will be on the same level of indentation. 
 Each direct child element will be on the same level as their siblings, and each grandchild on 
 the same level as THEIR siblings and cousins
